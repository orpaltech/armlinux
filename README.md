# armlinux

This is a build framework which was initially created to support sunXi and RaspberryPi boards. It can be extended in the future to support more hardware. The framework supports multiple build configurations defined by files with the extension ".conf" placed in the root folder. The existing configurations were created for my personal projects and they can be used as an example to create your own.

The idea of creating my own framework came from well-known and popular Armbian when I found myself having big issues to adjust this over-complicated solution for my own needs. Also, I didn't want to depend of anyone else when I encounter a bug or issue in the framework.

So, in general, one can say it is yet another "Armbian-like" framework, but I personally consider it something more.
