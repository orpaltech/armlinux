# armlinux

This is a build framework created initially to support sunxi and raspberrypi boards. It can be extended in the future to support more hardware. The framework supports multiple build configurations defined by files with conf-extension placed in the root folder. The existing three configurations were created for my personal projects and can be used as an example to create your own.
