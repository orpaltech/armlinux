# armlinux

This is a build framework which was initially created to support sunXi and RaspberryPi boards. It can be extended in the future to support more hardware. The framework supports multiple build configurations defined by files with the extension ".conf" placed in the root folder. The existing configurations were created for my personal projects and they can be used as an example to create your own.
