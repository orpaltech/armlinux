# armlinux

This is a build framework initially created to support sunXi and RaspberryPi boards. It can be extended to support more hardware in the future. The framework supports multiple build configurations, defined by files with the extension ".conf", placed in the root folder. The existing configurations you can find there were created for my personal projects. They can be used as an example to create your own configurations.

The idea of creating own framework was born from well-known and popular Armbian. On day I found myself to have big issues while adjusting this over-complicated solution for my needs. Also, I didn't want myself to be dependent on anyone else in case of a bug or issue in the framework.

So, in general, you can say it is yet another "Armbian-like" framework but I consider it something more than that.
