# armlinux

This is a build framework initially created to support sunXi and RaspberryPi boards. It can be extended to support more hardware in the future. The framework supports multiple build configurations, defined by files with the extension ".conf", placed in the root folder. The existing configurations you can find there were created for my personal projects. They can be used as an example to create your own configurations.

The idea of creating own framework was born from the well-known and popular Armbian. On day I found myself in big troubles while adjusting the over-complicated solution for my own needs. Also, I didn't want myself to be dependent on anyone else in case of any issue in the framework.

So, in general, you can say it is yet another "Armbian-like" framework but I consider it something more than that.
