#
# Note, BusyBox init doesn't support runlevels.  The runlevels field is
# completely ignored by BusyBox init. If you want runlevels, use sysvinit.
#
#
# Format for each entry: <id>:<runlevels>:<action>:<process>
#
# <id>: WARNING: This field has a non-traditional meaning for BusyBox init!
#
#	The id field is used by BusyBox init to specify the controlling tty for
#	the specified process to run on.  The contents of this field are
#	appended to "/dev/" and used as-is.  There is no need for this field to
#	be unique, although if it isn't you may have strange results.  If this
#	field is left blank, then the init's stdin/out will be used.
#
# <runlevels>: The runlevels field is completely ignored.
#
# <action>: Valid actions include: sysinit, wait, once, respawn, askfirst,
#                                  shutdown, restart and ctrlaltdel.
#
#	sysinit actions are started first, and init waits for them to complete.
#	wait actions are started next, and init waits for them to complete.
#	once actions are started next (and not waited for).
#
#	askfirst and respawn are started next.
#	For askfirst, before running the specified process, init displays
#	the line "Please press Enter to activate this console"
#	and then waits for the user to press enter before starting it.
#
#	shutdown actions are run on halt/reboot/poweroff, or on SIGQUIT.
#	Then the machine is halted/rebooted/powered off, or for SIGQUIT,
#	restart action is exec'ed (init process is replaced by that process).
#	If no restart action specified, SIGQUIT has no effect.
#
#	ctrlaltdel actions are run when SIGINT is received
#	(this might be initiated by Ctrl-Alt-Del key combination).
#	After they complete, normal processing of askfirst / respawn resumes.
#
#	Note: unrecognized actions (like initdefault) will cause init to emit
#	an error message, and then go along with its business.
#
# <process>: Specifies the process to be executed and it's command line.
#
# Note: BusyBox init works just fine without an inittab. If no inittab is
# found, it has the following default behavior:
#	::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS
#	::askfirst:/bin/sh
#	::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/reboot
#	::shutdown:/sbin/swapoff -a
#	::shutdown:/bin/umount -a -r
#	::restart:/sbin/init
#	tty2::askfirst:/bin/sh
#	tty3::askfirst:/bin/sh
#	tty4::askfirst:/bin/sh
#
# Boot-time system configuration/initialization script.
# This is run first except when booting in single-user mode.
