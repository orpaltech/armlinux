This directory contains SD-card image bootstrapping scripts. The scripts must be executed no matter if subsequent  customization (in directory ../custom.d) is used or not. The top-level directories listed here are:

1) The "common" folder contains platform-independent files
2) Optional architecture-specific folders: currently supported architectures are "sunxi" and "rpi"
